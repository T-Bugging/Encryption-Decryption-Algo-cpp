**Cipher Collection**

A curated set of classical and modern encryption-decryption algorithms implemented in C++. This repository is intended as a growing archive of cryptographic methods learned during college coursework and personal exploration.

 *Features*
Clean, readable C++ implementations

Support for both encryption and decryption functions

Preserves punctuation, spaces, and casing wherever appropriate

Modular structure for easy extension with more algorithms

 *Algorithms Included*
Caesar Cipher

Shift-based character substitution

Handles upper/lowercase letters and skips non-alphabetic characters

(More algorithms will be added soon.)
