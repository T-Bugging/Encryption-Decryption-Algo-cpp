# C++ Mini Projects

This repository is a collection of **small, standalone C++ programs** written in C++.  
Each program is usually contained in a **single file** (`.cpp`) and focuses on practicing one concept, algorithm, or idea.  

This repository serves as a **playground** for quick C++ projects — a kind of coding diary that grows over time.  

------------------------------------------------------------

# **STRUCTURE**
All files are independent and can be compiled separately.  
Example:
Cpp-Mini-Projects/
│── CaesarCipher.cpp

------------------------------------------------------------

# **HOW TO RUN**
Compile and run any program using g++:
g++ CaesarCipher.cpp -o output
./output

------------------------------------------------------------

# **CURRENT PROGRAMS**
- CaesarCipher.cpp → A simple text encryption using Caesar shift.  

------------------------------------------------------------

# **PURPOSE**
- Practice C++ syntax and problem solving.  
- Build small utilities and games.  
- Keep a consistent coding habit.  
- Share experiments publicly on GitHub.  

------------------------------------------------------------

# **NOTES**
- Each file is **self-contained**.  
- Projects may range from very simple (prime checkers, converters) to slightly more complex (games, text-based utilities).  
- If a project grows bigger, it will move to its **own repository**.
